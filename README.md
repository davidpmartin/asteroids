# asteroids

## Purpose
This basic recreation of the classic arcade game Asteroids was made as part of a paired group assignment (credit to my partner James Knox). It was created within the Processing Java environment.  

## Implementation
Objects and associated methods were defined for the three main components of the game: Ships, Asteroids and Aliens. Runtime is controlled by a Switch statement which moves the game through its various states (main menu, start level, game play, end level, game over). Object methods and functions are called conditionally in reaction to the associated events.

PVectors are used for object movement which allows a fine level of velocity operations and control.
